What's Open
===

Simple Android app that gets data from the [What's Open API](https://whatsopen.gmu.edu/api/) and 
displays it in an (ostensibly) pretty way, with some Android-specific bells and whistles.

Contributing

What's Open needs all the help it can get. Even if you don't feel 
like you can be helpful with the heavily technical aspects, 
we definitely need designers and technical writers.
 
There are many things that can be done with this project (see the "To Do" 
section), but sometimes it's the small things that count, so don't be afraid of 
contributing just for a spelling mistake.

If you need help at all please contact any SRCT member. We want people to
contribute, so if you are struggling, or just want to learn, then we are willing
to help.

Set Up
---

To get started, you'll need the following installed:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)

Modifying and Deploying Code
---

With the means of testing the app, you can really start contributing.

If you're new to Android development and don't know where to start, I recommend the 
[Android guides from Codepath](https://guides.codepath.com/android). They have a large 
volume of moderately helpful tutorials on both the Android SDK and most popular libaries. 
If you like spending money, [this is also a good tutorial](https://www.amazon.com/Android-Programming-Ranch-Guide-Guides/dp/0321804333), though it pretty much just covers 
the Android SDK, ignoring lots of very helpful libraries (which are used a lot by this project).
